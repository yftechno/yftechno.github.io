				<h3>About</h3>
				<p>Hello! My name is Kyle Atterson, and I love to be creative. I make websites (currently the Website Architect at Indiana State University), and games (both video and traditional) as a hobby. One day I'd love to transition to participating in game development in a bigger team than just myself, maybe as a project manager with you and your team!</p>
				<p>I can be described as a designer with a myriad of experience in modern coding and design programs. I bring a precise eye for detail and a vast knowledge of systems that allows me to create high quality design and technical work to specification. I also have experience in training new staff, working in group-oriented projects and scenarios, and have worked with developing web technlology to ensure accessible usability and proper architecture.</p>
